 NMLab Blockchain Final Project  *Group 4*
# Public House Bidding System

In this project, we use the publicity of blockchain to implement a house bidding system. We refer to a house to be built as a **project**, and then adding **items** into it. For firms seeking for some clients, they can find new tasks to do according to their professions, finishing the parts of projects relative to their professions. In the end, a project, in this final project as a *house* for example, can be done by those with willing and best ability in public. These firms would not be able to cooperate without such a system, and they used to find tasks by someone who wants to build a house. As a result, the best firm could not be found because the house builder(**tender** in this project) do not know the firm. The publicity of blockchain can work on this problem.
